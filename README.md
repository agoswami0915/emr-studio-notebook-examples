## FAQ

*Will these examples work outside of Amazon EMR Studio?*

- Most of the examples should work with/without minimal modifications even outside EMR Studio.

*How do I contribute my own example notebook?*

- Although we're extremely excited to receive contributions from the community, we're still working on the best mechanism to take in examples from external sources. Please bear with us in the short-term if pull requests take longer than expected or are closed.
